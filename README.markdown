## simLoco -- numerical model of the train ride

SimLoco attempts to model train with realistic physical model. The basic task is to build a specific train driving profile for the rail route. It should also provide basic tools for working with the timetable.

Sample output is available in the [results/sample_A.png](https://github.com/celestian/simLoco/blob/42c876afd8bebff62280fd83bd63bb7dd3389db4/results/sample_A.png)
